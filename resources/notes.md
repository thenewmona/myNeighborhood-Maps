[Google Maps Platform Overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)

[Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map)

Created my map.html, but getting a failed to compile error message 

Failed to compile
`./src/App.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './components/map.html' in 'C:\Users\thene\Google Drive\GWG phase 2\GWGprojects\myneighborhood-maps\src'`
This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.

Gonna try and get a map going outside of this project, just to get the map to render, than i will copy and paste into this project 

##Slack notes

good morning everyone
working on P7, and of course having issues right out of the gate
Don't think I have ever seen this one before in the Slack or forums

I am trying to build my map
I actually started in my project following Brad Traversy's video, but since he is not doing in REACT, I decided to just start totally separate, learn how to do it, and them copy it in my project

All I have is an HTML file as you can see in my screenshot, but somewhere it is pulling my swDB.js file , or at least that is what the console is showing.

I have no idea where this coming from.
I did a hard cache reload, thinking it is cached from my restaurant app
Anyone have this issue before or seen this issue before

did you try window.google.map.Map


Asmaa [6 minutes ago]
like this
```const map = new window.google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map")``` 


Asmaa [5 minutes ago]
also do you have your height like this
 ```height: 100vh;``` 


Also sent to the channel

@Asmaa actually I am just following a tutorial right now, and it is just a plain HTML file, I have no JS , no folders, or anything
I can not for the life of me figure out where this JS error's are coming from.


thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [3 minutes ago]
But where is the swDB.js file coming from in the very first line
That is what I am trying to figure out
