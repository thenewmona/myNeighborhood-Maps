[Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map)

Created my map.html, but getting a failed to compile error message 

Failed to compile
`./src/App.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './components/map.html' in 'C:\Users\thene\Google Drive\GWG phase 2\GWGprojects\myneighborhood-maps\src'`
This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.

Gonna try and get a map going outside of this project, just to get the map to render, than i will copy and paste into this project
